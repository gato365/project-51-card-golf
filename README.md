# Golf Card Game Project

## 1. Basic Game Setup (Deck, Cards, and Dealing)

### Implementation
- [ ] **Card Class**: Implement a class to represent each card, with attributes for suit and value.

- [ ] **Deck Class**: Implement a class to represent the deck. This should include methods to generate a full set of cards, shuffle, and deal them.
    - count: Returns the number of cards remaining in the deck. Useful for checking if the deck is empty
    - replenish: If your game rules require, you can add a method to replenish the deck with cards from the discard pile.
    
- [ ] **Player Class**: Implement a class to represent each player, holding their hand of cards.
    - show_hand: Display the player's current hand. This could be more elaborate than just printing the hand; for example, it could show which cards are known and which are hidden.
    - swap_card: Method to swap a card from the player's hand with one from the deck or the discard pile.
    - reveal_card: If a player's turn results in revealing a card, this method could handle that.
    - score: Calculate and return the player's current score, based on the cards in hand.

- [ ] **Initial Setup**: Code to initialize the game with a deck and players.

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test card creation and representation.
- [ ] Test deck shuffling and dealing functionalities.
- [ ] Ensure each player receives the correct number of cards.

## 2. Game Logic (Turns, Drawing, and Replacing Cards)

### Implementation
- [ ] **Turn Management**: Implement turn-taking logic for each player.
- [ ] **Drawing Logic**: Code for players to draw cards from the deck or discard pile.
- [ ] **Replacing Cards**: Allow players to swap out cards from their hand.

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test turn-taking sequence among players.
- [ ] Validate drawing and card replacement logic.
- [ ] Check for any logical errors or edge cases in turn mechanics.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics (Player Actions, Discard Pile Management)

### Implementation
- [ ] **Player Actions**: Implement actions that players can take during their turn.
- [ ] **Discard Pile Management**: Code to handle the discard pile and its interaction with the game.

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test various player actions for correctness.
- [ ] Ensure discard pile is managed correctly with each player's actions.

## 4. Scoring and End Game Conditions

### Implementation
- [ ] **Scoring System**: Implement the scoring mechanism based on the rules of Golf.
- [ ] **End Game Logic**: Code to determine the end of the game and declare a winner.

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test the scoring system for accuracy.
- [ ] Validate the end game conditions and winner declaration.

## 5. User Interface

### Implementation
- [ ] **Text-based Interface**: If applicable, create a basic text-based interface for the game.
- [ ] **Graphical Interface**: For a more advanced approach, develop a graphical user interface (optional and more complex).

### Testing and Debugging
- [ ] Test the interface for usability and clarity.
- [ ] Debug any issues with user inputs or interface displays.
